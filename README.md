ProcFromWin
===========

Get the process name, pid, and other information from a window.

This program was created after I had a little trouble finding out where a
"fakeav" program was running from, so that I could kill and remove it.
It has since been expanded quite a bit, to turn it into a (hopefully)
useful malware analysis/removal tool, with a number of nifty features.
I hope someone can put it to good use.
